## 📦 Installation

### ⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Warning (Expected Behavior)

**First-time users will see a Windows security warning** because this application is not yet code-signed with a commercial certificate.

**This is normal for new applications.** Here's how to proceed:

1. When you see "Windows protected your PC":
   - Click **"More info"**
   - Click **"Run anyway"**
2. This is a one-time warning
3. Your data and system are safe - this is open-source software

**Why this happens**: We're a new publisher, and obtaining a code signing certificate costs $400-600/year. We're working on getting one for v1.1.0 to remove these warnings.

**Your security**: All code is open-source on GitHub. The application runs entirely offline with no data collection or internet requirements.

### Option 1: MSI Installer (Recommended)
1. Download `Apex Solar Invoice Generator_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
2. If SmartScreen warns: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
3. Double-click to install
4. Follow the installation wizard
5. Launch from Start Menu or Desktop

### Option 2: NSIS Setup Executable
1. Download `Apex Solar Invoice Generator_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe`
2. If SmartScreen warns: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
3. Run the installer
4. Follow setup wizard
5. Launch from Start Menu or Desktop
