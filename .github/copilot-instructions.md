there is a vite project with react, typescript and tailwindcss named invoice-generator. i have added that in this workspace. its working fine. this webapp takes inputs from the user(like client details, company detials, project specifiactions etc.) and creates pdf invoices and also tracks them. i need a desktop app made with tauri with the same functionality as this web app this app is focused to work in windows so it needs to optimized for that. NOTE: do not change any design in the pdf generation part its designed and fine tuned according to the company needs. apart from that you can change anything and everything in the project according to your needs for a tauri project. i need a windows app doing this same fucntionality.

this is an arch system. if you are unable to edit files on your own then you should use sed or cat.
